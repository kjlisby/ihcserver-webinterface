IHCServer Web Interface v0.3

This is the web interface to IHCServer.

Since 0.2:

Now meant to be provided by IHCServer directly

Gets events by websocket (small indicator in right lower corner shows status, green = connected, yellow = ping, red = disconnected)

Removed dynamic controlpanel float stuff, for more static look

Added color indications of alarm, protected and entry I/Os
